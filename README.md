A recommendation system is a system that provides suggestions to users  for certain resources like books, movies, songs, etc., based on some data set. Movie recommendation systems usually predict what movies a user will like based on the attributes present in previously liked movies. Such recommendation systems are beneficial for organizations that collect data from large amounts of customers, and wish to effectively provide the best suggestions possible. A lot of factors can be considered while designing a movie recommendation system like the genre of the movie, actors present in it or even the director of the movie. The systems can recommend movies based on one or a combination of two or more attributes. The dataset used for the system is Movie Lens dataset. The data analysis tool used is Python.
